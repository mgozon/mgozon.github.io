            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I am a student at the University of Michigan studying mathematics and computer science.
                I am interested in understanding the theoretical aspect of things and why they work,
                but also how they can be applied for the benefit of society.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                I also like to solve puzzles, usually through math and cs competitions, such as the AMC, AIME, and USACO besides many others, and I do intend to participate in the Putnam and ICPC.
                I had previously been the head of the math and cs club at Pioneer, and many guides, documents, and other materials can be found in the Resources tab.
